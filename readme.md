# 🤖 Intelligent .NET Commit Analysis with AI

## 📌 About

This project integrates **AI-powered commit analysis** into GitHub repositories.
Whenever a commit is pushed, the system:

1. Captures the code *diff*.
2. Sends it to **Gemini Mini AI** for review.
3. Generates a **report of potential issues**.
4. Automatically creates a **GitHub issue** with severity labels.

The goal is to **improve code quality** and **prevent bugs** before they reach production.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```plaintext
Commit → GitHub Actions → AI Analysis → GitHub Issue
```

* **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflow on commit.
* **Python/Node.js scripts**: Extract diffs & integrate with AI.
* **Gemini Mini API**: Detects code issues.
* **GitHub API**: Creates issues with detailed reports.
