# 🤖 Intelligent .NET Commit Analysis with AI (Gemini)

## 📌 About

This project integrates **AI-powered commit analysis** directly into GitHub repositories.
Whenever a commit is pushed, the system:

1. Captures the **code diff**.
2. Sends it to **Gemini AI** for analysis.
3. Generates a **report of potential issues** (security, logic, best practices).
4. Automatically creates a **GitHub issue** with severity labels (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`).

The goal is to **improve code quality** and **prevent bugs** before they reach production.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```plaintext
Commit → GitHub Actions → AI Analysis (Gemini) → GitHub Issue
```

* **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflow on push to `main` or `develop`.
* **Python scripts** (`analyze_diff.py`, `create_issue.py`): Extract diffs and integrate with Gemini.
* **Gemini AI / Vertex AI**: Detects potential code issues and generates a Markdown report.
* **GitHub API**: Creates issues with detailed findings and severity labels.

## 📋 Example Report

```markdown
## 🔍 Commit Analysis Report
**Commit:** abc123 | **Branch:** main | **Author:** @nathalia  

### ⚠️ Detected Issues
- **Critical:** Use of `Thread.Sleep` in async environment  
- **High:** Missing input validation in public method  
- **Medium:** Outdated comments  
- **Low:** Non-descriptive variable name  

**Improvement Suggestions:** (optional)

_Analysis automatically generated by Gemini AI._
```

## 🚀 Roadmap

* Pull Request analysis before merge ✅
* Multi-language support 🌍
* Auto-fix suggestions 🛠️
* Integration with tools like SonarQube / CodeQL 🔐

---

## 🔑 Setup

1. Configure **secrets** in your GitHub repository:

   * `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` → Vertex AI / Gemini service account JSON
   * `GH_TOKEN` → GitHub token with **repo:issues** permission

2. Add the workflow in `.github/workflows/analyze-commit.yml`.

3. Push a commit → wait for automated AI analysis.

---

## ⚡ Notes

* First commit or commits without changes will generate a **mock report**.
* Labels are automatically assigned based on severity detected in the report.
* The system is fully extensible to multiple languages and integrations.
